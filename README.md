## Mathematical Background

The Mandelbrot set consists of complex numbers that do not diverge when iterated through the function `f(z) = z^2 + c`, where `z` is the current value and `c` is the initial value. Specifically, the set includes all complex numbers `c` for which the sequence `f(0), f(f(0)), f(f(f(0))), ...` remains bounded.
